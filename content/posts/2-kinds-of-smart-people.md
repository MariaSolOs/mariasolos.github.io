I always had great relationships with my professors, especially the math ones (I majored in math after all).

I don't remember what the lesson was about that day, but I remember one random day of 8th grade math when the teacher stopped talking about trigonometry and said: **"There are 2 kinds of smart people: There are the naturals, the ones that just get it and don't need to review or study to do well. Then there are the disciplined, the ones that _don't_ get it and need to stare at the textbook for hours, solve hundreds of exercises, and days later they finally understand the concept."**

I'm definitely a type 2. I'm smart but not natively intelligent. I need to put in a lot of effort to actually digest new ideas, and the good grades I got throughout school were the result of ~not having a social life~ being nerdy and disciplined. This is something I'm proud of: I did well because I earned it.

Not trying to throw shade at the geniuses, but I do hope that this is a reminder that it's okay to struggle. To not get things right away. To have to put a lot of effort into doing well. But when you finally succeed, you'll know that you deserved it.
